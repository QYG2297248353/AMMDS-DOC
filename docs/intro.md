## About Us

We are a group of people who love technology and innovation. Our team members not only have a deep background in software engineering but also have a unique passion for movies and TV series. This inspired us to create AMMDS, a platform designed specifically for managing and enjoying personal media libraries.

## Project Origin

One day, when we were discussing how to better save, share, organize, and collect movies and TV series, we found that there was a lack of an application that could automatically organize, enrich metadata, and support multi-platform access on the market.
