## About Us

We are a group of people passionate about technology and innovation. Our team members not only have a strong background in software engineering but also a unique enthusiasm for movies and TV series. This passion inspired us to create AMMDS.

A platform specifically designed for managing and enjoying personal film and television libraries.

## Project Origin

One day, while discussing how to better save, share, and organize our collections of movies and TV series, we found that there was a lack of applications that could automatically organize, enrich metadata, and support multi-platform access. Thus, we decided to develop such a tool that not only helps users easily manage their film and television collections but also greatly improves organization efficiency through smart algorithms that match local files with online metadata.
