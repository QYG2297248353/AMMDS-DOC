# Docker

**Docker** is an open-source platform designed for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of applications. It enables developers to package an application along with its dependencies into a standalone container, ensuring that the application runs consistently in any environment. Containers are lightweight and portable, making them ideal for microservices architectures and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) processes.

## One-Click Run

```sh [docker-cli]
docker run -itd \
  --name AMMDS \
  -p 8080:80 \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/ammds/data \
  -v $(pwd)/db:/ammds/db \
  -v $(pwd)/download:/ammds/download \
  -v $(pwd)/media:/media \
  --restart always \
  qyg2297248353/ammds:latest
```
